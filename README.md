# Breathe

An alert system to warn you when the pollution level in your city (or region) reaches dangerous levels. Currently work in progress.

## General Idea
- You get email, SMS, WhatsApp (other apps maybe) notifications for pollution levels in the city you choose.
- Why? I just moved to a polluted city and I think I'll actually use this.

## Tasks
- [x] Setup endpoint to fetch data from api.
- [x] Add signup functionality.
- [x] Add delete user functionality
- [ ] Map coordinates to cities / regions.
- [ ] Query API for pollution data every one hour, for every user.
    - Need to figure out how to access, datasources, prisma, outside resolvers.
- [ ] Notify user of levels.
    - [ ] SMS
    - [ ] Email (mailtrap / sendgrid)
    - [ ] Whatsapp (try whatsapp's api)
